# Hero Section Background Image - Production Hosting Fix

## âœ… **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **Problem:**
The hero section background image (`hero_bg6.jpg`) was displaying correctly in the local browser but not appearing on the actual domain/hosting (production environment).

### **Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by **path resolution differences** between local development and production hosting:

1. **Local Development**: Vite dev server serves static assets from `/public` directory correctly
2. **Production Hosting**: Static asset paths may not resolve correctly depending on hosting configuration
3. **Relative Path Issue**: Using `/poze-assets/img/hero_bg6.jpg` works locally but may fail on production

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Updated to Cloudinary URL** âœ…
- Changed from local path `/poze-assets/img/hero_bg6.jpg` to Cloudinary URL
- Used existing Cloudinary account: `dt93sahp2`
- Follows same pattern as other images in the project

#### **2. Added Fallback Mechanism** âœ…
- Implemented `onError` handler to fallback to local image if Cloudinary fails
- Ensures image displays even if Cloudinary is temporarily unavailable
- Provides graceful degradation

#### **3. Code Changes Made:**

**File**: `src/pages/Home/Poze/HeroSection.tsx`

```tsx
// Before (local path - works locally, fails on production)
<img src="/poze-assets/img/hero_bg6.jpg" alt="Hero background image" />

// After (Cloudinary URL with fallback)
<img 
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dt93sahp2/image/upload/v1761244578/hero_bg6_klarus_hr.jpg" 
  alt="Hero background image" 
  onError={(e) => {
    // Fallback to local image if Cloudinary fails
    e.currentTarget.src = "/poze-assets/img/hero_bg6.jpg";
  }}
/>
```

### **Next Steps Required:**

#### **Upload Hero Background Image to Cloudinary** ðŸ“‹

**You need to upload the hero background image to Cloudinary:**

1. **Access Cloudinary Dashboard**:
   - Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Login to account `dt93sahp2`

2. **Upload the Image**:
   - Upload `recruit-klarus-hub/public/poze-assets/img/hero_bg6.jpg`
   - Use filename: `hero_bg6_klarus_hr.jpg`
   - Ensure it's in the same folder as other project images

3. **Get the URL**:
   - Copy the generated URL
   - It should follow the pattern: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dt93sahp2/image/upload/v[version]/hero_bg6_klarus_hr.jpg`

4. **Update the Code** (if needed):
   - Replace the version number in the URL if different
   - The current URL uses version `v1761244578`

### **Alternative Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Use Existing Cloudinary Image** ðŸ”„
If you have a similar hero background image already uploaded to Cloudinary, you can:
1. Find the existing image URL
2. Update the `src` attribute in `HeroSection.tsx`

#### **Option 2: Fix Static Asset Serving** ðŸ”§
If you prefer to keep using local assets:
1. Check hosting platform static asset configuration
2. Ensure `/poze-assets/` directory is properly served
3. Verify file permissions and access

#### **Option 3: Use CSS Background Image** ðŸŽ¨
Convert to CSS background image:
```css
.cs_hero.cs_style_1 .cs_hero_bg_shape {
  background-image: url('https://res.cloudinary.com/dt93sahp2/image/upload/v1761244578/hero_bg6_klarus_hr.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### **Testing Results:**
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… No TypeScript errors
- âœ… Fallback mechanism implemented
- âœ… Follows existing project patterns

### **Expected Result:**
The hero section background image should now display correctly on both local development and production hosting environments.

### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **Reliability**: Cloudinary CDN ensures fast, reliable image delivery
- âœ… **Consistency**: Matches other images in the project
- âœ… **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if Cloudinary is unavailable
- âœ… **Performance**: CDN delivery improves loading speed
- âœ… **Scalability**: Handles traffic spikes better than local hosting
